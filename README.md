## Website Creation &  Product Specific Copywriting

### <b>Cymbus.com</b>

Launched April 2021, this website was created as a customer facing resource and sales enablement tool for service providers to direct their end customers to. Completed within 60 days, including a major design pivot 2 weeks prior to launch. I was a key stakeholder in the development, design, and implementation of the website. I developed the copy for the Product pages, developing compelling narratives, clear messages, and value props that would resonate with SMBs and enterprises; in addition to developing all the marketing resources highlighted under the Resources tab.
